It is also not far to Malioboro and other attractions such as Prambanan.  However, be aware that traffic in Yogja is very slow and congested, so it can take 40-60 minutes to travel just 20Km by car.  Hotel breakfast is excellent!  We also had dinner one night, and the Balinese cuisine is excellent.  The only complaint I have is that the towels had a bad smell.  At first I thought it was just a bad batch, but the towels we received in the following days also did not smell good.

We asked that they raise the temp and they said they would, but they couldn't do that either. Even after that, would not provide extra blankets.
