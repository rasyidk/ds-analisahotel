Our room was also not properly equipped with toiletries and some of the towels looked like they should have been discarded a while ago. Inexplicably, the safe was located at the bottom of the cupboard: nice exercise, but I could have done without having to get on my knees every time! 

But there was much to be positive about. Overall, the staff was really friendly and helpful, notably in the restaurant and the bar.The bartender is really very good: we tried several cocktails and all were top-of-the-line: the Mai Tais and lychee martinis were exceptional. The breakfast is a big spread and sumptuous. Other meals are a bit thin by way of choice, but the food is tasty. The executive room was comfortable once the air conditioning was fixed.

Everyone who came after us were receiving their keys and even getting free upgrades when I paid for that bigger room and was asked to wait every time I enquired about our room. We only got our room 1.5 hours after the check in time and the manager even mentioned that the staff at the reception messed up our booking. This entire ordeal was rectified after they switched us from a dilapidated room and view to the actual room we booked.

The room is a nice size with a small balcony overlooking the pool. Noise from the pool area can be heard in the room when the pool is busy but it is not a concern at night. The room is a little dated - mainly the bathroom. The towels and bedlinen are old and grey from over use. The bedlinen had stains on them. Not really 5 star standard. Both towels and bedlinen should be replaced with new ones. They are also very stingy with the complimentary water. Only 2 small bottles are provided per day which is not really enough. At night there was a loud constant humming sound in the room. It was not from the air conditioner as I turned it off. I couldn’t work out where it was coming from. I didn’t have a good night sleep my whole stay as a result. The breakfast selection is ok, nothing special. The restaurant menu is very limited.
