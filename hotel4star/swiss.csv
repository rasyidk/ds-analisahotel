They have special dinner buffet rate for hotel guests on every Saturday and the variety is quite good. The hotel is clean and room is comfy. There is not much to see at the surroundings of the hotel but one can call Grab to go to Malioboro street easily. Grab service is at very affordable rate and can get a car quite easily & the driver will arrive quite fast.","Sempurna","10,0","  31 Jan 2020","Perjalanan 3 malam"

"7","id","It was extremely good. Everything was almost perfect. I first fell in love with the lobby the moment i entered, welcomed by the lemongrass luxurious smell, accompanied by the gold platings of the interior design. My expectations was surpassed again when they served us welcome drinks and a small piece of dessert.   The room, the lounge area and interior design of the whole hotel was well thought-out and even the toilet bowl was extra large.The lobby toilet is super nice with marble walls and not to mention the breakfast buffet - it was great!!!! Looking forward to going back to the hotel everynight, didnt regret staying there for 4 nights. Usually i dont like to stay at a place for too long when travelling!   However, 2 things to improve on for the hotel management:   1) some of the towels had stains on them. I know it's hard for white cloth to stay white forever but since youre a 4.5/5 star hotel please take note of this. 2) the floor for the bathing cubicle had some grit/some pebbles or dirt at the corner/sides. Please do proper cleaning before letting guests check in. Thanks! ","Sempurna","10,0","  31 Des 2019","Perjalanan 4 malam"

"15","sg","Had an amazing stay at Swiss Belboutique. The Holywood room was very well designed and appointed, and came with a massive bed, bigger than king size. Pillows and sheets were very clean and comfortable. Mattress firmness was just right. There was even a pillow menu. Breakfast was fabulous for the price. The spread was great and there was even a choice of local brewed coffee or Illy espresso. The spa and gym were also commendable. The staff was very skilled and service oriented, while the gym equipment was comprehensive and well maintained. The hotel's staff in also deserve special mention. Almost everyone we encountered - from the lobby to the restaurant - was courteous and attentive. Must commend the hotel for its training and customer centricity.

"21","sg","Hotel is fairly new, not a big hotel. What is best about the hotel is their staff service. Staff are very friendly, polite, always greet you with a smile. They are professional and take their duty seriously. We booked a shuttle service to the airport and was told to check back later for confirmation. The staff wrote down our request. When we checked back later, they couldn't seem to find our earlier request & told us to check back later again. I was not very happy with this. They later called my room to apologise as they found my earlier request and informed me that it has already been confirmed. I appreciate them calling me to apologise for this oversight, many will merely brush it aside. The hotel had early breakfast at 3am to cater to guest who had to eat before sunrise during Ramadan. Many choices for breakfast although mostly the same spread daily. We stayed for 6 nights & found that we mostly eat the same things daily anyways so not a problem. In the evening, hotel has free coffee, local dessert & dates at lobby level.   Room is reasonably big, very clean & had everything you'll need. It is serviced everyday & consumables replenished daily. Bed is very comfortable with a pillow menu offering many choices of pillows.  Location is not ideal, nothing much to do or see nearby. On a positive side, it is quiet. Galleria Mall is 10mins walk away. The hotel provides free shuttle service to/from Malioboro St.   We will recommend this hotel.","Sempurna","10,0","  9 Mei 2019","Liburan romantis 6 malam"

Even after housekeeping had vacuum the carpet and changed the bed sheets, mites are still attacking us. The air exchange in the room with fresh air from outdoor is poor and ventilation needs to be improved.  Hot water for shower and wash basin took more than 5 mins to arrive even after we had turn the tap to the hot zone side and run the water each time we wish to use it.","Bagus Sekali","8,0","  16 Mar 2019","Perjalanan bisnis 4 malam"

"27","id","They have impressed us right from the beginning.   From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted with big smiles and politeness. We were welcomed with welcome drinks and snacks while we were waiting for the front desk to process our booking. Even there's a little note left on our room's desk by the manager.  The politeness didn't just stop there. All throughout our stay, the staffs from the bellboy to the valet area and both Swiss-Cafe and Chadis restaurants were all attentive and very courteous.  The breakfast buffet is really a must try. We managed to try most of the dishes and we loved each one of them, especially the traditional dishes in the outdoor area, such as bakmi jawa, sop empal, gorengan, gudeg, etc. We felt we didn't even need to go everywhere else to taste the local food. They're all delicious.  Other highlight is their rooftop restaurant/pool area in the evening. The lighting and view was beautiful. They have panoramic view of the city as well. We decided to have some drinks and snack on Valentine's day and there was a band playing romantic songs. All of it really created a perfect atmosphere for Valentine's day. We were glad that we decided to spend the night there.  Both the bathroom and bedroom were very clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. We got a great view overlooking the city as well.  They have exuded what Central Java and Jogja is known for: polite and full of manners. I think we've found our favourite place to stay in Jogja.","Sempurna","10,0","  12 Feb 2019","Liburan romantis 3 malam"

Breakfast was okay if you enjoy local food but spread can be improved. F&B staffs are very friendly and clears away tables fast.
