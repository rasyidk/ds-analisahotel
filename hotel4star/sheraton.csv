The rooms are also nicely refurnished, at a good size and the architecture is fantastic. The spa and its staff are especially good.

"8","hk","booked this hotel because of ratings and previous experience with sheraton hotels. unfortunately this place was way below expectation. booked a mountain view room at higher price which i would not recommend. the room faces the pool area which is quite noisy and the condition of room is questionable. furniture and bathroom showed heavy marks of wear and tear. light switches of bed lamp fell off once touching. one lamp would not shut off at all. AC very noisy. wifi barely working. changed instantly and without big issue to garden view room which is completely renovated. however room climate was quite humid, clothes and shoes have been damped overnight. could be the rainy season effect, but should bot happen in a 4.5 star hotel. gym/spa/restaurants not visited. pool is in a good condition, quite a plus of this hotel, same as the service of the employees. breakfast is a turn down, the quality of the food and the presentation was not what i expect in that price category, would not recommend and will not book again.","Bagus","6,0","  23 Des 2019","Perjalanan 2 malam"

But the hotel would need some new work and renovation like the pool and kidsclub . not sure if the pool filter and pump was working . also the pool surrounding need more regular cleaning and sweeping to prevent dirty from getting into the pool .","Bagus Sekali","8,0","  30 Nov 2019","Jalan-jalan keluarga 5 malam"

The bedroom is quite spacious and comfortable. Unfortunately, due to its proximity to a mosque, I was awakened every night at 3:45AM by their call to prayer which lasts for at least 30 minutes.  I would be careful to choose the location of the hotel next time.","Bagus Sekali","8,0","  6 Des 2019","Liburan romantis 2 malam"

"16","gb","Very large resort hotel close to Yogyakarta airport. Just what we needed after two days of walking and cycling around temples and villages. The large outdoor pool with swim-up bar was nice but not great for laps. Service was 5* and they run a free airport shuttle service every 30 minutes (takes 5 minutes to reach the airport).    The only negatives were that flannels were not provided, the bed had a very slight musty smell (like the room had not been used for a while) and the aircon was either on or off. The temperature can't be controlled from each room. Everything else was great. Phenomenal for the price.","Sempurna","10,0","  6 Feb 2019","Liburan romantis 1 malam"

The staff are fantastically courteous, very helpful & with top class service. Unfortunately the only negative parts are the hotel sliding wadrobe which we found already old & worn difficult to slide to open & also the swimming pool male toilet which is not so clean and also with lack of liquid soap. Hopefully these 2 areas can be easily upgraded to make it a perfect top class hotel.","Sempurna","10,0","  9 Nov 2018","Jalan-jalan keluarga 2 malam"

"23","au","We booked a suite which was a fantastic room. The pools are absolutely magnificent. The staff were all fantastic. Breakfast too was absolutely magnificent.   Room service and everything else at the hotel is very very expensive. I bought a small bottle of coke from the drug store / snack  / souvenir shop and was asked to pay 30000 rupiah. Anywhere else and you would pay 5000.  We had our 2 boys with us one a 6 month old baby and our 3 year old. We needed an extra bed for our 3 year old and we're charged 400000 rupiah per night. Way too expensive.  To be fair we were given a crib for free.   There was no access for a pram from the main lobby to the drop off pick up area. You have to go down a floor via the elevator and walk around. We learnt that on our 3rd day there. A ramp could easily be installed surely. In saying that,  the staff were always ready to help us.   Besides the negatives we did enjoy our stay there. I would recommend the hotel to a couple but probably not for a family. ","Bagus","6,0","  15 Agt 2018","Perjalanan 3 malam"

Not only do they know your last name but they know the room number, too. They are delighted you are their guest. I currently live in the UK and I assure you this is not the feeling you get in any hotel. The grounds are really beautiful.

My husband noted the damp smell of the rooms and some molds in some areas. Otherwise i was happy. We were given rooms that were so noisy due to some repair work they were doing, which is rather annoying. The staff tried to rectify the issue by moving us to other rooms but it probably took like 2 hours for the other rooms to be ready. Otherwise the staff are fantastic and polite. The hotel is amazing with 2 pools and lots of areas to sit around. Love the toilet and bathtub. They provide shuttles to malioboro and airport too. I am overall pretty happy.","Bagus","6,0","  23 Mei 2018","Perjalanan 2 malam"

It was so sad to fly 14 hours to have an aerial view of the garden and not have “room with volcano view” as requested.   It’s the rainy season and getting drenched daily without a warm hair dryer, a heating blanket, nor central air with a heat function was great.   The ginger tea in the foyer induced indigestion in several guests.  It is a lovely hotel for landscaping but the grounds are lacking any overall features.  No sky garden or easy access to the lounge when restless nor faster than 40 minutes for requested items.   If not for my other half there, I wouldn’t stay there.
