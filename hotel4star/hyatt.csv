"4","us","Beautiful buildings and grounds. Old room in need of renovation/modernization, especially the bathroom. Stains on upholstery. Footstep noise from overhead. Annoyingly-slow check-in, where you are asked to take a seat in the lobby while someone takes your passports and comes and goes several times with forms and eventually room keys. We'd prefer to do it in a couple of minutes standing at the front desk like everywhere else. Breakfast was fine, nothing special, busy and loud (more children here than normally seen at 5-star hotels). The spa facilities were not entirely clean, and need renovation as well. The location is outside the center, with slow traffic. We were glad we booked just one night to check it out first. We chose to go elsewhere the next day.","Bagus","6,0","  23 Jan 2020","Perjalanan 1 malam"

The tennis courts were run down, the shower head was like rusty, and the sink in the bathroom should have been cleaned just a bit better around the rim. But like I said above, the service at the hotel and the restaurant were amazing!!  I can see myself coming back!","Bagus Sekali","8,0","  12 Nov 2019","Liburan bersama teman 3 malam"

"14","us","The friendliness, helpfulness, and determination of the staff are qualities unmatched in Southeast Asia. We would choose this hotel time and time again based on the employees alone.  Z and his wife A made our mornings at breakfast memorable and so special. Z went out of his way to prepare gluten-free pancakes, muffins, and noodle dishes for me. They were absolutely perfect and again, this speaks of the excellent service provided by the staff of the hotel. We are so grateful!   Everything else about the property leaves much to be desired. The location is far from restaurants, coffee shops, and walkable areas. Smoking is permitted everywhere on the property--sure there is a smoking designation but even on our floor, the room was equipped with an ashtray and ashtrays near the elevators as well. The gardens are decent compared to Bali, the food is nothing special, and the property is truly dated--probably the most dated hotel we've ever lodged with.","Bagus Sekali","8,0","  14 Agt 2019","Jalan-jalan keluarga 4 malam"

"26","hk","Disappointments:  * We arrive very early after a 12 hr drive from Jakarta and no early check in available, later on we see many rooms vacant * No offer to look after our bags until we check in, so we have to carry our luggage around town, really not helpful * When we arrived later at check in time staff greeting us at foyer can’t speak English as they can’t understand what I’m saying * After getting the key we have to show ourselves to our room, the lady gives us the key then she immediately looks down at computer and doesn’t even tell us where the lifts are we have to ask her. Not felt welcome at all * When we get to the room there is no bath mat in the room - when I call room service they say they will send one up immediately it never arrived. Can you believe it? * Basin in the bathroom become blocked have to call room service to unblock it, takes forever for them to come and unblock it so we can’t wash our hands after using the toilet. * I ordered a hamburger 1 night it was so overcooked black both sides * Room service orders often don't come within the advertised time of 20 mins on the menu. I think they should be free if they are late * I ordered a beer while sitting at the pool it never came * Pool bar closes early * I ordered an iron to iron my shirt and it took honestly like 40 mins for it to come to our room. * As soon as you check out you are bumped off the WiFi no offer to give you a guest pass until you leave.  Bottom line: Very slow service","Bagus","6,0","  24 Des 2018","Perjalanan 3 malam"

"44","sg","The biggest strength of this hotel is their staff, they are professional, pleasant, communicates well, efficient and proactive. The check in and check out process was the best I have ever experienced. The second biggest strength is the scenic landscape with a view of Merapi. The Swimming pool was very unique surrounded by trees. The food options was good, rooms were clean and tidy. Some point of improvement can be on upgrading the room facilities like having USB charging ports which are found in newer hotels and better sound isolation in rooms. In short, I will be back to this hotel for my next Jogjakarta visit. ","Sempurna","10,0","  27 Apr 2018","Perjalanan 5 malam"

"48","sg","Overall credit to the Hotel establishment as the service staff; from the doorman; front desk to the room keepers are all very well trained and always have a ready smile. Special mention to 2 outstanding staff, 1 of which is Ms Sri, a service staff in the restaurant as well as Chef Zaenal, who literally went out of their way to ensure that our stay in Hyatt Regency goes beyond our expectations. Each morning, my wife & I literally look forward to our morning breakfast as Sri will make our special cup of Latte & keep checking with us whether we would like anything outside of the extensive breakfast buffet spread. Chef Zaenal went one step further to specially prepare our request of Nasi Kunning Campol or Mee Soto or any other Indonesian food we may wish to try and sample. My wife & I have travelled many places and stayed in numerous hotels & resorts over the past 35 years & we are truly impressed with these staff who paid attention to small details & went out of their way, sincerely to make the guests feel at home.    The Hotel and facilities may be dated and in need of a spruce up renovation but the service quality of staff truly make it a memorable stay indeed!    Keep up the good work especially Sri & Zaenal!","Bagus Sekali","8,0","  8 Mar 2018","Jalan-jalan keluarga 4 malam"
