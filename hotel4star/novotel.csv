"8","id","Well , I turned only to be told that the room that I was supposed to be in wasn’t available because of the air cold problem .  They said it was broken so therefore it will be hot in the room .  So , they booked me to a different hotel , and they “ upgrade “ me to an  executive room , the hotel called  Quality.  Hmm ,  for the amount that I paid , I personally wouldn’t go there , the room was tiny and very dated , and very old !   And very disappointing on Novotel behalf .

The room was spacious and comfortable, and my only complaint is that the AC wasn't switched on in the room the first day (so when we tried to adjust the thermostat, nothing happened!). Fortunately, this was remedied the following day by the housekeeping staff. We would definitely stay here again.","Sempurna","10,0","  3 Jul 2019","Liburan romantis 2 malam"

There was no sofa bed for 4th person and they said they will charge for an extra bed.  The staff didn't speak very good English.  The dinner buffet was limited choice. During one breakfast, my son found a bug in one of the food.  Overall not a hotel I would recommend to anyone. ","Biasa","4,0","  6 Jul 2019","Jalan-jalan keluarga 3 malam"

"28","us","I have stayed in this and other hotels in the Yogya region and the Novotel remains the best in its price range.  Rooms are reasonable, comfortable, and pleasantly laid out.  Always good, the recently renovated restaurant has both poolside and interior spaces that are city, spacious, and pleasant.  Food offerings include both Indonesian and European and are both good and reasonably priced.  The pool setting is beautiful, and the hotel's fitness center has three good quality treadmills (and other machines), three full sets of weights, a weekly yoga class, and a nice lay out.  Location is particularly convenient the University, but also offers easy access both to Jl. Malioboro and out-of-town tours.  Above all, though, this hotel has a friendly and professional staff, and a Polish-born manager who knows Indonesia and runs the hotel well.

We were expecting a king bed only but were surprised by the extra large bed which equals 2 queen beds combined, hence 3 of us could sleep comfortably in this huge bed.  The room fittings are in good condition however it was a challenge to climb in and out of the bath tub for shower as the side is quite tall.
