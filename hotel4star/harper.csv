"2","id","This is what I expected to get while staying in a hotel. I visited Yogya for a holiday...but the weather so extreme. It was rainy all day. Though the place so near with the center of the city, but I prefer to stay away from wet. Hotel should be the second place to get the experiences in all condition. Friendly greeting, customerized, comfort & cleanliness room. Breakfast with lot of variety. I recommed this hotel...keep up the good record...","Sempurna","10,0","  28 Nov 2017","Perjalanan 1 malam"

Breakfast buffet offers great variety of local foods (different offerings for 3 days in a row). Free wifi provided. Location is near Tugu and a little off the busy & crowded malioboro, not walking distance but grab cars are aplenty and affordable (15rb to malioboro / kraton) or there are becak (trishaw) for 30rb if you feel so. There is a bakery and cafe too right next to the lobby.","Sempurna","10,0","  13 Des 2019","Jalan-jalan keluarga 3 malam"
"5","us","Unless you speak fluent Indonesian, I cannot recommend staying here. The rooms are clean, the restaurant is excellent, and they are eco friendly. My experience is described below:  Before arriving I booked a tour to Borobudur though this hotel which was confirmed by them. However, when I arrived, they hadn't arranged a driver and there was an additional 600k IDR transport charge (you shouldn't pay over 250k IDR MAX for transport to Borobudur). Naturally I declined to book though them.  Then, I received a note saying since I had the do not disturb sign up when housekeeping came by, I could call 6 when I was ready for them written in both English and Indonesian. This resulted in a saga of 3 tries to request room service and 5 tries to request clean mugs that were met with complete incomprehension even when using the paper with both Indonesian and English, until I went to the front desk. The front desk was able to resolve everything, but also felt the need to inform me that the staff had other things to do.   All in all, this was my least favorite place to stay in Indonesia.","Bagus","6,0","  29 Okt 2019","Perjalanan 3 malam"

"25","my","Check in and check out were smooth and hassle free. We booked two rooms, one was king and one was a twin room. However, please note that this would be at the hotel's discretion as it depends on availability. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. They would greet you as you enter and ready to assist when needed.     Rooms were clean, nicely designed and new. It would be great if the room included a dressing table though. The beds were comfortable. Toilet amenities were provided. Bathroom's maintenance could be slightly improved but overall, still in good condition. The best part about the room would be all the snacks and whatever you can find in the fridge are free! In fact, they would even replenish the items when they clean the room.    For those that enjoy Indonesian food (which I do), food options are plentiful and delicious  but for non Indonesian food lover, you may be slightly disappointed as the options are quite limited.     The hotel is located near Malioboro Street, a place you could shop for batik (majority) and other knick knacks (like tshirts, etc) but not exactly walkable. So, you could opt for Grab, the hotel has a Grab order machine at the entrance.    All in all, my family and I had a great time staying at Harper and we would definitely stay here again when we come to Yogyakarta.   ","Sempurna","10,0","  4 Agt 2018","Jalan-jalan keluarga 3 malam"

"31","sg","The most overwhelming, awesome, outstanding guest service attitude that I ever experienced in my 25 years of numerous International Travels. Most of all, never ever in my history of stays at hundreds of hotels my request for vegetarian breakfast was honored with such great concern and care. Despite a couple of vegetarian dishes being a part of the international breakfast menu every morning, they proactively reached us 'each evening' to let us select as many from 8 options of vegetarian food that would want to prepare specially for us. They even packed the extras and leftovers without a single blink or question. Most humble and warm staff. How I wish that every other hotel in the world sends their staff for training to this hotel to learn the true meaning of customer service.     I wish to congratulate the hotel management for their holistic and visionary thinking. I will certainly write a special letter to the Indian Ministry of Tourism, besides that of Indonesia, expressing my views on how the hotels should operate citing this hotel as a star role model.","Sempurna","10,0","  30 Mar 2018","Perjalanan 3 malam"

Breakfast was good but after awhile it can be boring as almost the same kind of food were being served everyday. The hotel has a very good patisserie on the ground floor as all their pastries and cakes were very delicious. It would be great if the Hotel can provide a free shuttle service to the main street which is not too far from the Hotel. Though it is only a walking distance of about 20 mins but the weather can be very hot and sometimes raining - not conducive to walk.
