Dan ketika cekout disuruh nunggu juga -+ 15 menitan. Pdhl sebelum2nya menginap (4 kali) dihotel ini tdk ada pengalaman sprti itu . Cm overall dari segi kebersihan, pelayanan, dan lokasi kami sangat cocok.","Bagus","6,0","  14 Agt 2018","Liburan bersama teman 1 malam"

"19","us","The hotel was much better than I expected.  An easy walk to the local tourist attractions but there weren't many decent restaurants nearby.  Mostly only small, local places.  It felt a bit isolated.  There is one bar that's about a five to ten minute walk away.  Rickshaw drivers hang out in the parking lot and it's only a few dollars to go to Malioboro where it's a bit more lively.  Check out the alleyways around the hotel for local life.

However the next really early we request breakfast box, order that a day before at the restaurant, reminded the night before to front desk....then in the morning it's NOT ready!? They gave us some old bakery stuff that even have some white mildew like on the surface!!  So we just throw those out.

"31","us","Honestly I loved the place. It is just like a fancy Hotel in USA but cheaper. LOL  I loved the housekeeping staff ! If you have any problem with your room just ask and they will fix it !    Room was nice and just like in the pictures.  Breakfast is a huge INDONESIAN buffet (90% of guests are Asian) but any Westerner can also find eggs,bread, fruit,cereal, plenty of choice if you don't feel like Nasi Campur first thing in the Morning.    The only thing that bothered me was that you could hear everything from the Hallway in front of your door. Be aware Indonesians often travel with small kids and from early am you will have small kids running down the hallway screaching ! But I was so happy i found this place after staying at Rumah Roso, which was a dump...so I almost didn't mind.    Also most Indonesian Ladies will go into the pool fully clothed or not at all so the pool was mainly used by toddlers.LOL    All in all I liked it a lot plus there is thie amazing restaurant ""Spesial Sambal SS"" NEXT DOOR ...try it !!!!","Sempurna","10,0","  14 Nov 2017","Liburan romantis 2 malam"

"47","de","Das Hotel liegt wirklich supergünstig. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind fußläufig zu erreichen. Ein kleiner Tipp, ca. 700 Meter entfernt vom Hotel liegt die Backpackerstraße. Dort ist alles günstiger und es gibt dort auch einige Agenturen bei denen man die Touren und den Weitertransfer buchen kann. Empfehlen kann ich Anna's. In dieser Straße gibt es auch einen Laundryservice, der nach Kilo abrechnet. Dieser ist im Hotel sehr teuer.    Das Hotel selbst ist wirklich klasse und man kann es zu diesem Preis uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen.
