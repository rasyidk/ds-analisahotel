The only thing I was not comfortable was the bidet as it smells like sewage. I already complained to the hotel and they said it’s because of the rubber on the bidet and they are going to change them.
The hotel was also located beside a mall but there’s no proper shelter...so in rainy seasons, you have to borrow umbrella to cross. I can’t help but wonder why they never take that into consideration when building the hotel. Other that those two, it’s really a comfortable and clean and I will definitely be back.",Bagus Sekali,"8,0",11 Des 2019,Perjalanan 5 malam

What we didn’t like :we have decided to order a breakfast to our room as we were going to leave early for sightseeing. The only breakfast Menu list in our room was already used with a date of August 2018. We  dialed and asked the  room service a new room service breakfast menu  and  received it. shortly.
After deciding our choices we did put in front of our door before midnight as it was written.
 Set our alarm as we were sure that we will receive our breakfast and not to rush downstairs to find a breakfast place.

Unfortunately the morning the list was still hanging from our door. No one picked up ( although an hotel employee from the room service brought us the new list)
So we ended up rushing and having a open buffet breakfast.",Bagus Sekali,"8,0",15 Okt 2019,Jalan-jalan keluarga 2 malam

Breakfast is not free or include in the package, you have to pay additional fee. 2. Free carpark are not inform by the staffs, even the car park attendants  unless you personally ask them/. If you are not hotel guest, you have to pay the car park fee. 3. Room cleaning at around night (8pm onwards) are terrible, some of the dirty robes and towel were not changed. Maybe becasue the room service staffs were rushing to go home? But morning and afternoon, the room service do a great job.
