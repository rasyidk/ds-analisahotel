3,gb,The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  Next to the hotel is a large shopping mall where you can find plenty of food stalls and restaurants.  The main area for improvement is its shower room design which has no door to stop water getting out to the toilet when showering. The buffet breakfast offers plenty of food choices.,Bagus Sekali,"8,0",8 Des 2019,Perjalanan bisnis 5 malam

19,sg,"Nice hotel.  It helps that there is a mall nearby. Breakfast food is okay, but if you're not so used to Indonesian food, you might not like the breakfast.  A bit noisy because there is a mosque, I think, nearby and you get wakened up by the early chantings.",Bagus Sekali,"8,0",3 Sep 2017,Perjalanan bisnis 4 malam
20,gb,We stayed here to go to the local temples. Hotel looks very grand. The issue we had was that there was quite a bit of mold in the bathroom. Which we self tested  and did come off. It seems that the hotel needs a bit of attention. The staff were lovely though and the manager moved us to a different nicer room to compensate us and gave us a car for the day. Which was very nice of them. I think a nice hotel but needs to make sure cleanliness is well looked after.,Bagus,"6,0",27 Agt 2017,Perjalanan 2 malam
21,us,"It's still a good hotel and is located next to a mall. The staff is excellent, but confusing at times with their English skills. For the most part, the hotel is in great shape, but there are lots of little things that might upset people. It's not a big for me, but the towels were thread worn, or some of the signs were too small to see or placed in odd viewpoints. It's hard to maintain a nice hotel over time, so I can't complain.",Bagus Sekali,"8,0",12 Jul 2017,Perjalanan 3 malam
22,us,"The Royal Ambarrukmo is the epitome of a quality hotel, with clean, well appointed rooms, comfortable beds, a beautiful swimming pool, and an astounding breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet was possibly the highlight of my stay--you can get anything you want, from just about any world culture, all freshly prepared and delicious. I especially liked the freshly pressed melon juice, made to order omelets, and crisp pastries. The hotel is next to a shopping mall that sells just about anything you might need. It's only a 15-minute drive from the airport and 20 minutes from Malioboro Street (the heart of Yogyakarta).",Sempurna,"10,0",12 Jul 2017,Perjalanan bisnis 4 malam
